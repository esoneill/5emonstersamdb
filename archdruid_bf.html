<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nature’s Champion.</strong> While the archdruid is conscious, wearing no armor, and in a natural environment or terrain, such as a desert, forest, or mountain, it adds its WIS modifier to its AC (included above). In addition, it is resistant to cold, fire, lightning, poison, and thunder damage.</li>
<li><strong>Nature’s Weapons.</strong> When the archdruid hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage (included in the attack), the archdruid’s choice.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack</strong> . The archdruid makes three Thorned Staff or Nature’s Wrath attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.</li>
<li><strong>Thorned Staff.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: + 7 to hit, reach 5. ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage (the archdruid’s choice).</li>
<li><strong>Nature’s Wrath.</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: + 9 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (5d8 + 5) cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage (the archdruid’s choice).</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting.</strong> The archdruid casts one of the following spells, using WIS as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17).<ul>
<li>At will: animal friendship, druidcraft, entangle, speak with animals</li>
<li>3/day each: heat metal, spike growth, plant growth, speak with plants</li>
<li>1/day each: polymorph, insect plague</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change Shape.</strong> The archdruid magically transforms into a Beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form, which is Humanoid. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the archdruid retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA modifiers, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</li>
