<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hold Breath.</strong> The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Heads.</strong> The hydra has five heads and is resistant to the blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and unconscious conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Reactive Heads.</strong> For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Wakeful.</strong> While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack</strong> . The hydra makes as many Bite attacks as it has heads.</li>
<li><strong>Bite.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Noxious Breath (Recharge Special).</strong> The hydra exhales poisonous gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 CON save, taking 40 (9d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While the hydra has five or more heads, this action has a recharge of 6. The recharge range increases for each head the hydra has below five. For example, a hydra that starts its turn with two heads can recharge this feature on a 3, 4, 5, or 6.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bloody Burst (Has Fewer Than Five Heads).</strong> The hydra squeezes the stumps of its severed heads, spraying blood and gore. Each creature within 5 feet of the hydra must succeed on a DC 16 CON save or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn and poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
